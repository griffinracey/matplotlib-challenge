Challenge Assignment 5 - Matplotlib

For the summary statistics section, I primarily used in-class Activity 3 from Day 3 of Data Visualization. This gave me insight on finding the summary stats (mean, median, etc.), quartiles, and outliers. 

I used various activities from Days 1-3 of Data Visualization to assist with the bar, pie, line, and scatter plots. 

Day 3 Activity 8 was very helpful with the correlation and regression sections of this assignment. 

For the aggregation method for the summart stats table, I used the following resource:
https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/intro_tutorials/06_calculate_statistics.html

To label the pie chart's with the percent values using autopct:
